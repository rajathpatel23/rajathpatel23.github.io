# Attention Mechanisms in Transformers: MHA vs MQA vs GQA

This guide explores the core attention variants in modern transformers, focusing on the mechanisms themselves: Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). We'll understand why each exists and their fundamental architectural differences.

---

## Quick Overview

- **Self-Attention**: Each token looks at other tokens to build contextualized representations
- **Multi-Head Attention (MHA)**: Multiple independent attention "heads" in parallel; each head has its own Q, K, V projections
- **Multi-Query Attention (MQA)**: Share Key/Value projections across all query heads; reduces parameters significantly
- **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)**: Groups of query heads share K/V projections; balances expressiveness and efficiency

---

## 1. Self-Attention Foundations

### Core Intuition
Self-attention is a **content-based lookup** over the sequence:
- **Queries (Q)** ask "what do I need?"
- **Keys (K)** say "what do I offer?" 
- **Values (V)** contain the information to aggregate
- **Core computation**: `softmax((Q @ K^T) / sqrt(d)) @ V`

### Mathematical Formulation

**Notation**: batch `B`, sequence length `L`, model width `D`

**Single-head projections**:
```
Q = X W_q,  K = X W_k,  V = X W_v
Shapes: X: [B, L, D], W_q/W_k/W_v: [D, d], Q/K/V: [B, L, d]
```

**Attention computation**:
```
1. Attention logits: A = (Q @ K^T) / sqrt(d)  ‚Üí [B, L, L]
2. Apply causal mask: A[i,j] = -inf for j > i (generation)
3. Attention weights: P = softmax(A, dim=-1)
4. Output: Y = P @ V  ‚Üí [B, L, d]
```

### Implementation
```python
def scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask=None):
    # Q,K,V: [B, L, d]
    scale = 1.0 / math.sqrt(Q.size(-1))
    logits = torch.einsum('bld,bmd->blm', Q, K) * scale  # [B,L,L]
    if mask is not None:
        logits = logits.masked_fill(mask == 0, float('-inf'))
    probs = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
    return torch.einsum('blm,bmd->bld', probs, V)
```

### Limitations
A single head blends all relations into one pattern, which can be too coarse for complex linguistic structure.

## 2. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) - The Gold Standard

### Why Multiple Heads?
Different heads specialize in different aspects:
- **Syntactic patterns**: Subject-verb relationships, phrase boundaries
- **Long-range dependencies**: Coreference resolution, discourse structure  
- **Entity tracking**: Following entities across long sequences
- **Semantic relationships**: Similarity, causation, temporal ordering

### Architecture Details

**Head configuration**:
- Model width `D`, number of heads `H`, head width `d_h = D / H`
- Combined projections: `W_q/W_k/W_v: [D, H√ód_h]`
- After projection, reshape to heads: `Q/K/V: [B, H, L, d_h]`

**Processing flow**:
```python
# Multi-head projection
Q = X @ W_q; K = X @ W_k; V = X @ W_v               # [B,L,D]
Q = Q.view(B, L, H, d_h).transpose(1, 2)            # [B,H,L,d_h]
# ... attention per head ...
Y = Y_heads.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(B, L, D) @ W_o
```

### Computational Cost
- **Attention compute**: `O(B √ó H √ó L¬≤ √ó d_h)`
- **Memory for logits**: `O(B √ó H √ó L¬≤)`
- **Typical settings**: `D=4096, H=32, d_h=128` (many 7-70B models use `H ‚àà [24,40]`)

### Trade-offs
‚úÖ **Advantages**:
- Highest model quality and representational richness
- Each head can specialize in different linguistic phenomena
- Well-established training dynamics

‚ùå **Disadvantages**:
- KV cache scales with `num_heads`, increasing inference memory
- Higher bandwidth requirements during generation
- More expensive for long-context applications

## 3. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) - Maximum Efficiency

### Core Innovation
**Share Key and Value projections across all query heads** while keeping query heads independent.

### Why This Works
- **Parameter efficiency**: Dramatically reduces the number of parameters in attention layers
- **Key insight**: Queries can be diverse, but Keys/Values can be shared across heads
- **Result**: Significant parameter reduction with minimal quality loss in many tasks

### Architecture Changes

**Projection differences**:
```python
# MHA projections
self.w_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)      # H heads worth
self.w_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)      # H heads worth  
self.w_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)      # H heads worth

# MQA projections  
self.w_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)      # H heads worth
self.w_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_k)          # 1 head only (shared)
self.w_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_k)          # 1 head only (shared)
```

**Runtime sharing**:
- Projection weights: One `W_k: [D, d_h]` and `W_v: [D, d_h]` for all heads
- Runtime tensors: Single `K: [B, L, d_h]` and `V: [B, L, d_h]` referenced by every query head
- Queries remain multi-headed: `Q: [B, H, L, d_h]` for diverse attention patterns

### Attention Pattern Differences

**What changes in MQA**:
- **Query diversity maintained**: Each head still has independent query patterns
- **Shared key/value space**: All heads attend over the same key-value representations
- **Reduced expressiveness**: Some loss in ability to learn specialized key-value transformations per head

### When to Use MQA
‚úÖ **Advantages**:
- Significant parameter reduction (46.9% in our experiments)
- Faster training due to fewer parameters
- Maintains most attention expressiveness through diverse queries

‚ö†Ô∏è **Trade-offs**:
- Slightly lower quality than MHA on some complex tasks
- Less specialized key-value transformations per head
- May require careful hyperparameter tuning

### Real-World Usage
- **PaLM**: Uses MQA for efficiency in large-scale deployment
- **Falcon**: Adopted MQA for fast inference
- **Chinchilla**: Demonstrated MQA effectiveness at scale

## 4. Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) - The Sweet Spot

### Design Philosophy
**Compromise between MHA quality and MQA efficiency** by dividing heads into groups that share K/V.

### Architecture Details

**Group organization**:
- Divide `H` heads into `G` groups
- Each group shares one K/V set: `num_kv_heads = G`
- Queries per group: `H / G`

**Projection structure**:
```python
# GQA projections (G groups)
self.w_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)                    # H heads worth
self.w_k = nn.Linear(d_model, num_kv_heads * d_k)        # G heads worth
self.w_v = nn.Linear(d_model, num_kv_heads * d_k)        # G heads worth
```

**Runtime organization**:
- **Per group**: One `W_k^g: [D, d_h]` and `W_v^g: [D, d_h]`
- **Runtime tensors per group**: `K^g: [B, L, d_h]`, `V^g: [B, L, d_h]`
- **Head mapping**: Query head index ‚Üí group index for K/V routing

### Parameter Scaling

**Memory and computation**:
- **Parameters scale with**: `num_kv_heads` instead of `num_heads`
- **Example** (`D=4096, H=32, d_h=128, G=4`):
  - **GQA parameters**: Proportional to 4 KV heads instead of 32
  - **Reduction**: ~8√ó fewer K/V parameters than MHA

### Performance Characteristics

**Quality vs. Efficiency**:
- **vs MHA**: 90-95% of quality with major memory savings
- **vs MQA**: Better quality with moderate memory increase
- **Sweet spot**: `G ‚àà {4,8}` groups work well empirically

### Implementation Considerations
```python
# Head-to-group mapping
def get_kv_group(head_idx, num_heads, num_groups):
    return head_idx // (num_heads // num_groups)

# Attention routing
for head in range(num_heads):
    group = get_kv_group(head, num_heads, num_groups)
    attention_output[head] = attention(Q[head], K[group], V[group])
```

### Real-World Adoption
- **Llama-2**: Uses GQA with optimized group configurations
- **Code Llama**: Balances code understanding with efficiency
- **Mistral**: Adopted GQA for production deployments

|---------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Model Quality** | Highest | High | Good |
| **Parameter Efficiency** | Lowest | Good | Best |
| **Training Speed** | Slowest | Fast | Fastest |
| **Attention Expressiveness** | Maximum | High | Limited |
| **Implementation Simplicity** | Simple | Moderate | Simple |

### Concrete Recommendations

**Choose MHA when**:
- Maximum model quality is required
- Parameter count is not a constraint
- Research/experimentation phase
- You need maximum attention expressiveness

**Choose GQA when**:
- Need balance between quality and efficiency  
- Building production systems with parameter constraints
- Want to reduce model size while maintaining good performance
- Quality-sensitive tasks with efficiency requirements

**Choose MQA when**:
- Parameter efficiency is critical
- Training on limited computational resources
- Building lightweight models for deployment
- Maximum parameter reduction is needed

### Model Size Considerations
- **Large models (>10B parameters)**: Parameter efficiency becomes more important, GQA/MQA more attractive
- **Medium models (1B-10B)**: GQA often provides the best balance
- **Small models (<1B)**: MHA may be preferred for maximum quality with manageable parameter count

## 7. Key Implementation Insights

### Attention Pattern Differences

**How each mechanism processes information**:

**MHA (Multi-Head Attention)**:
- Each head learns completely independent attention patterns
- Maximum expressiveness: heads can specialize in different linguistic phenomena
- Each head has its own "view" of what's important in the sequence

**MQA (Multi-Query Attention)**:
- All heads share the same Key/Value representations
- Query heads maintain diversity in what they "ask for"
- Reduced specialization in how information is represented (shared K/V)

**GQA (Grouped-Query Attention)**:
- Groups of heads share Key/Value representations
- Balances specialization (within groups) with efficiency (shared K/V)
- Creates "clusters" of heads that work with similar information representations

### Common Implementation Pitfalls

‚ö†Ô∏è **Watch out for**:
- Forgetting `sqrt(d_h)` scaling in attention computation
- Wrong head‚Üígroup mapping in GQA implementation
- Inconsistent tensor shapes when switching between mechanisms
- Not properly reshaping tensors for multi-head computation

## Conclusion

The evolution from MHA ‚Üí GQA ‚Üí MQA represents a fundamental trade-off in attention mechanisms: **expressiveness vs. efficiency**.

### Our Experimental Results Show:
1. **Parameter Efficiency**: MQA achieves 46.9% reduction, GQA achieves 37.5% reduction
2. **Quality Trade-offs**: GQA maintains ~90-95% of MHA quality with major efficiency gains
3. **Practical Impact**: The choice of attention mechanism significantly affects model size and training efficiency

### Key Takeaway
Understanding these attention variants is essential for modern transformer development. The "best" choice depends on your specific constraints:
- **Research/Maximum Quality**: MHA
- **Production Balance**: GQA  
- **Resource Constraints**: MQA

Each mechanism represents a different point on the quality-efficiency spectrum, and the field continues to find new ways to optimize this fundamental trade-off in transformer architectures.
